        Calling this method after finishing is undefined behavior.

        The returned index is the position of the voucher in the merkle tree.
        The index counting restarts at every input.

      summary: Finish the advance state request
      description: |
        This method must be called to finish the advance state request received by the DApp backend.
        The property status in the request body should be either 'accept' or 'reject';
        otherwise, the method will fail and there will be no effect.

        When running inside a Cartesi machine, the Cartesi Server Manager will revert the machine,
        discarting all the vouchers and notices for the current input.
        When running with the Mock, the Mock will discard the vouchers and notices.
        Reports are not discarted in case of reject.
